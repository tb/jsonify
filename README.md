# Welcome to JSONIFY

As a web developer, I often find myself sharing JSON data to my colleagues by email or chat. Once I get the JSON data by email or chat, I would usually copy and paste it to an IDE or some JSON tool to format it. This often causes issues because sometimes JSON is unknowingly cut off due to character limits, or I simply missed a closing bracket while copying.

I started this project because I wanted to simplify the above process. JSONify.io allows you to share JSON data easily.
